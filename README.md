# Discord Bot (name pending)

Potential commands:

- Create/read/update/delete (CRUD) Wireguard network
  - Inputs: Network name, users, desired expiration, ???
- CRUD user from existing Wireguard network
  - Inputs: Email, IP range, games, ???
- CRUD server/session in emulator
  - Inputs: ???

Other features:

- Pull Discord roles and use those for permissions

Ideas/questions:

- Host on same VPS as Wireguard server? (Probably not, maybe Aaron's server?)
  - For now: https://glitch.com/
- Discord donation/sponsorship/boosting gives more features? Longer network expiration, more players, etc?
